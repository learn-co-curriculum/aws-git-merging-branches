# Merging Branches with Git

## Learning Goals

- Perform standard and fast forward merges with the `git merge` command.
- Explain the difference between standard merges and fast forward merges.
- Explain two other techniques that can be used when incorporating changes:
  `squash` and `rebase`.

## Introduction

In the last lesson, we learned how to create and use branches so we can work on
new features without affecting the code in the `main` branch. The next step is
to learn how to incorporate those changes into the central code base once we're
ready. In this lesson, we'll learn to perform merges using the `git merge`
command. We'll also learn how different types of merges affect our Git history.
Finally, a couple of additional techniques that give us greater control over the
commit history will be introduced.

## Merging Branches

To merge one branch into another, the steps are:

1. Switch to the receiving branch, i.e., the one you want to merge the other
   branch into. This is frequently `main`, but it can be any branch in your
   project.
2. Run `git merge <branch-to-merge>`.

So, for example, if we had a `bug-fix` branch we were ready to merge into the
`main` branch, we would switch to `main` then run:

```console
$ git merge bug-fix
```

That's it. If there aren't any conflicts (more on this in the next lesson), Git
will merge all the changes you made in `bug-fix` into the code and update
`main`'s Git history to include the commits that were made on the `bug-fix`
branch. What that history winds up looking like depends on what's in the commit
history of the two branches.

### Standard Merge

Let's say the status of our repo is the following:

![unmerged branches, standard merge](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/unmerged-changes-standard-merge.png)

We have created a `new-feature` branch and have made three commits on that
branch. In the meantime, two additional commits have been made on the main
branch. When we run `git merge new-feature`, Git will do two things:

1. It will combine the commits from both branches into the main branch's Git
   history, in order of when they were made.
2. It will create an additional commit, a _merge commit_, and add that to the
   end of the commit history.

It would look like this:

![merged branches, standard merge](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/merged-changes-standard-merge.png)

When you run the command, Git opens a file in the Git command line editor so you
can enter a commit message for the merge commit. You can add a message, save the
file and close it to complete the merge, or you can just close the file if the
default message is adequate.

The advantage of this type of merge is that it retains the full history of
commits from both branches, and retains the order in which the commits were
made. The disadvantage is that it adds a new, "empty" commit, that just
indicates when the two branches were merged. It will also show the commits for
`main` and for the feature you added interspersed in the history, which can make
it harder to follow. You can imagine that, if you're working on a very active
project with lots of branches being created and merged in, the Git history could
get quite long and complicated.

### Fast Forward Merge

A fast forward merge is just a simplified version of the standard merge, in
which the history of the receiving branch has not changed since the second
branch was created:

![unmerged branches, fast forward merge](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/unmerged-changes-fast-forward.png)

In this case, the merge simply appends the commits from `bug-fix` to the end of
the main branch's history. No merge commit is necessary, because it is clear
from the commit history when `bug-fix` was merged in:

![merged branches, fast forward merge](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/merged-changes-fast-forward.png)

Because nothing has changed on the main branch since we created the branch, when
we merge we are simply "fast forwarding" the main branch to the current state of
the feature branch.

### Squashing

There are a couple of other options Git provides to help keep your Git history
cleaner and easier to read; the first of these is `squash`.

Say we've created an `add-login` branch where we've developed login
functionality for our application. Our branch contains quite a few commits, one
for each discrete step we completed to get it working. We've thoroughly tested
our code, and we're ready to merge it in. However, we know if we use a standard
merge, all those commits will be interspersed among the commits on our `main`
branch, and a merge commit will be added. This will make our Git history harder
to read and full of a lot more detail than we really need.

What `squash` allows us to do is "squash" all the commits on the `add-login`
branch together into a single commit on our `main` branch. With this approach,
the addition of the feature is documented without cluttering up our history.

Before the merge:

![unmerged changes, squash](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/unmerged-changes-squash.png)

After the merge:

![merged changes, squash](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/merged-changes-squash.png)

The main downside of using squash is that the history of the commits on the
`add-login` branch will be lost. Whether this is an acceptable tradeoff depends
on your needs.

We will see an example using `squash` in a later lesson.

### Rebasing

Another option you can use to keep your Git history cleaner is `git rebase`.
This command can be used either after the fact (i.e., after merging) to clean up
your commit history, or as an [alternative to merging][merge-vs-rebase].

When `rebase` is used in place of `merge`, it "rewrites" history by moving
(rebasing) the point at which the feature branch was created to the end of the
main branch's history. As a result, the history shows all the commits on the
main branch, followed by all the commits from the feature branch, making it look
similar to a fast forward merge.

If we use the `new-feature` example from above:

![unmerged branches](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/unmerged-changes-standard-merge.png)

The result after rebasing would look like this:

![rebased branches](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/git-github/merging-branches/rebased.png)

The advantages of rebasing are that it makes it easier to see the history of
different features, since those commits are kept together, and it removes the
need to create _merge commits_. The disadvantage is that the order of the
commits no longer reflects when they were made â€” you have "rewritten" history.

**Warning:** Rebasing is generally considered to be an "advanced" technique,
because rewriting your Git history can cause problems, especially when you're
working as part of a team. If you rebase your Git history and your collaborators
have an earlier version of the code with a different history, it can be quite a
mess to clean up! For this reason, we recommend getting comfortable with merging
and with the collaborative workflow before delving into rebasing.

## Exercise: Merging the changes in our feature branch

In the previous lesson, we added some books to our Python study resources, then
created a branch to make the book titles into links. Our next step will be to
`merge` our changes into the `main` branch.

Note: before continuing, make sure the state of your project matches where we
left off at the end of the last lesson (after the exercise).

On the `main` branch, the file should look like this:

```md
# Python Study Resources

## Books

- Composing Programs (Chapter 1-2) [Free]
  - This is a great book for learning compsci concepts in addition to Python
- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python [Free]
  - Has short, easy projects that involve different modules
- Python Crash Course , 2nd Ed
  - Beginner friendly intro to fundamental concepts 
```

And the commit history should look like this:

```console
commit 79971225f5084ac808dc6fc39a385acf45071fc5 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Your Name <youremail@email.com>
Date:   Sat May 7 19:32:26 2022 -0400

    add books to list

commit 1b3142a6c7ebec9001f2fe4a2436746d9b076a49
Author: Your Name <youremail@email.com>
Date:   Sat May 7 19:29:21 2022 -0400

    initial commit
```

If you switch to `add-links`, they should look like this:

```md
# Python Study Resources

    initial commit
```

If anything in your code doesn't match what's shown above, we recommend
revisiting the lesson on undoing changes to figure out how to fix it. It will be
good practice!

Once you're ready, go ahead and merge the `add-links` branch into main:

1. Make sure you're on the `main` branch.
2. Run the `git merge` command.
3. Verify that the file on the `main` branch has been updated with the links.

When you're done, the commit history on the `main` branch should be the same as
the commit history on the `add-links` branch.

Make sure you have successfully merged the `add-links` branch before moving on.
We will continue working with this project in the next lesson.

## Check for Understanding

Before moving on to the next lesson, check for your understanding of this material
by answering the following questions in your own words:

- What is the difference between a standard merge and a fast forward merge?
- What do we mean when we say that rebasing rewrites the history of a repo?

## Conclusion

Which technique you choose for incorporating the changes in one branch into
another will depend on your needs. If it's more important to maintain a complete
history of all the changes and commits, a standard merge is probably the way to
go. If, on the other hand, if you want your commit history to provide concise,
readable documentation of how your code has changed and expanded over time, you
may want to use one of the more "advanced" techniques, such as rebasing.

Rebasing is a very powerful tool that is used frequently by many people.
However, it can also cause problems, especially when you're working as part of a
team. We have introduced it here so you are aware of it and what it can do for
you, but we recommend that you focus on getting more comfortable with using
branches for now.
